    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>Hi,
my name is Sehejdeep Singh. I am a student at NSUT pursuing B.Tech in ECE branch. I have always been very passionate towards things
related to tech but never got any opportunity to take it further ahead.
I am also a huge a petrolhead and i do make reels on cars and upload them on my insta profile. 
This is the first ever website made by me and i learnt making it within 5 days so it required a lot of hard work and time so hopefully you'll like it.
